    text: `Modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories, relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. Relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about 1% of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the Sun. Quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope. The combination of these two theories is relativistic quantum mechanics, and it describes the behavior of small objects traveling at high speeds or experiencing a strong gravitational field. Relativistic quantum mechanics is the best universally applicable theory we have. Because of its mathematical complexity, it is used only when necessary, and the other theories are used whenever they will produce sufficiently accurate results. We will find, however, that we can do a great deal of modern physics with the algebra and trigonometry used in this text.`,

      <p>Done? Wonderful. You can find a great list of all the pronunciations <a href='http://esperanto.davidgsimpson.com/eo-alphabet.html'>here</a> which I recommend adding to your favorites. Pronunciation may seem a bit boring at first but it's important to get a firm foundation, it will help you the rest of the way.</p>

      <p>There's a few questions to answer below and then we'll move on to practice. (Don't worry, there's no penalty for getting one wrong, just try again after a little more thought/study.)</p>

      <b>Note</b>: You may have difficulty typing letters with accents/diacritics on a standard keyboard. One popular alternative (and one compatible with this dictionary) is to add an x after the circumflex letter. This means that 'ŭ' becomes 'ux' and 'ĉ' becomes 'cx' (x is not a standard letter in Esperanto and merely signifies that the previous letter should carry a diacritic)
