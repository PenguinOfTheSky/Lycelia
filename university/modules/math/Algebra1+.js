      <p>Remember, for this class you should have a pencil and paper available at all times. If a calculator is required it will be noted in the lesson, otherwise attempt to do all problems on paper and show your work. Keeping notes down on paper is also highly recommended. Don't write a textbook, but write down enough to remember relevant facts and formulas.</p>
      <p>Before we get into what algebra is, let's start with a pratical exercise. </p>
      <p>In algebra an equal's sign (=) means that what is on the left side of the equal's sign has the same value as on the right side, even if they may be in different forms.</p>
      <p>Note: In this course "/" signifies division, * signifies multiplication. When writing problems down on paper, you may use a small dot to medium sized dot in place of an asterisk. You may also use a รท in place of a / for division if you so choose. </p>
